Making a calculator app  

Aiming high while trying to make this app as good as possible so that I could put it on my portfolio. 
Besides trying to master the basics of Javascript, CSS & HTML - I want to really get deep into UI / UX & make it
as visually stunning app as possible. I also want to really get into accessibility testing as I think it's important skill for the future of web development (& even necessary as European accessibility act is taking it's form in June of 2025)
